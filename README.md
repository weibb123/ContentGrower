Grow my social media account... AI/Data Science approach


### Project Description
 Leveraged Llama 3.1 AI model to suggest engaging captions and hashtags for my social media posts and videos.
 
 Developed a data dashboard to understand user behavior and trends in Plotly.
 
 Increased my account impressions by 5\% through data-driven optimizations.

 Before starting.. it is crucial to think about what makes a video popular. It is necessary to use AI for extra cost and lead to greater viral?

 However, we do not know the algorithms of instagram, youtube, nor tiktok. My guess is that it has to be the thumbnails + title generate more clicks.
